The data package
===========================================

You can download the data package used in this workshop from Zenodo.
This data package contains the following:

* Demultiplexed fastq.gz files for each of your samples with amplicon sequences and quality scores
* The SILVA 16S taxonomic database version 138
* The taxonomic classifier, specifically pre-trained to use on this data set
* The bash scripts used to run the entire workflow
* The WALKTHROUGH with instuctions on how to run thse analyses on the crunchomics cluster
* All intermediate results, such that you can choose to skip very time consuming steps.

Skipping steps
-------------------------------------------
It is not necessary for this workshop to have a very powerful computer.
You can run most of the analyses on a laptop, and if that does not work, 
you can skip that step and continue with the intermediate files in your data package.


.. tip::

   When you follow the steps in this tutorial, you will overwrite the pre-computed intermediate files present in your data package.
   Make sure to keep a copy of the original data package, such that you can always restore these pre-computed files when needed.
